    <h2>Code Implementation Highlights</h2>
    <div class="highlight-card">
      <h3>Data Integrity: Transaction & Category Types</h3>
      <p>
        Implemented critical business logic on the backend to maintain data consistency. The system enforces that 'Income' transactions can only exist in 'Income' or 'Neutral' categories, and 'Expense' transactions in 'Expense' or 'Neutral' categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a user action violates this rule (e.g., changing a category's type), the backend automatically re-assigns the affected transactions to the user's <span class="code-snippet">"WITHOUT CATEGORY"</span> default category. This logic is handled in the <span class="code-snippet">CategoryController</span> and <span class="code-snippet">TransactionController</span>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-card">
      <h3>JWT Authentication</h3>
      <p>
        The application employs <span class="code-snippet">JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</span> for secure and stateless authentication. Upon successful user login, the API issues a JWT containing claims about the user. This token is then sent with subsequent requests in the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` scheme. The backend validates these tokens to authenticate requests, ensuring that only authorized users can access protected resources without the need for session state on the server.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-card">
      <h3>Efficient DTO Mapping with AutoMapper</h3>
      <p>
        To streamline the process of converting data models (Entities) to Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for API responses, the project leverages <span class="code-snippet">AutoMapper</span>. This library automates the mapping of object properties, significantly reducing repetitive boilerplate code in the controllers and making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-card">
      <h3>Containerized Deployment with Docker & Azure</h3>
      <p>
        The entire application is containerized using <span class="code-snippet">Docker</span>. This encapsulates the application and its dependencies, ensuring a consistent environment from local development to production. These Docker images are deployed to <span class="code-snippet">Azure App Service</span>, a fully managed platform that simplifies deployment, scaling, and monitoring, providing a robust and reliable hosting solution in the cloud.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-card">
      <h3>Centralized Constants</h3>
      <p>
        To avoid hardcoding magic strings, a static <span class="code-snippet">Constants</span> class was created in the backend project (<span class="code-snippet">/Utils/Constants.cs</span>). This holds shared values like the default category name, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-card">
      <h3>Dynamic Server-Side Sorting</h3>
      <p>
        The API endpoints for fetching categories and transactions were enhanced to accept <span class="code-snippet">sortBy</span> and <span class="code-snippet">sortOrder</span> query parameters. The backend now performs the sorting using LINQ, ensuring the frontend receives data in the desired order efficiently. This reduces the processing load on the client.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-card">
      <h3>UI/UX & User Confirmations</h3>
      <p>
        On the frontend, user experience is improved by providing clear warnings for actions with side effects. When a user changes a category's type, an <span class="code-snippet">MatSnackBar</span> appears with a "Confirm" action, warning them that some transactions may be moved. This prevents accidental data changes. Custom styles were applied to the snackbar for a consistent look and feel.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-card">
      <h3>API Security: Rate Limiting</h3>
      <p>
        To protect against potential abuse and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, the backend implements <span class="code-snippet">Rate Limiting</span>. Using the <span class="code-snippet">AspNetCoreRateLimit</span> NuGet package, the API restricts the number of requests a client can make within a specified time period. This helps ensure the stability and availability of the service by preventing excessive traffic from overwhelming the server resources.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-card">
      <h3>Secure Account Deletion with Cascade</h3>
      <p>
        For user data management and privacy, the application provides a secure account deletion feature. When a user initiates account deletion from the settings, the system performs a complete removal of their account. This is achieved through <span class="code-snippet">cascade deletion</span> configured at the database level, ensuring that all associated data—including user profiles, transactions, and categories—are automatically and permanently removed.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-card">
      <h3>Interactive API Documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI</h3>
      <p>
        The project integrates <span class="code-snippet">Swagger (OpenAPI)</span> to provide comprehensive and interactive documentation for the backend API. This tool generates a user-friendly web interface that allows developers to visualize and interact with the API's resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. It's invaluable for testing endpoints, understanding request/response formats, and facilitating collaboration between frontend and backend teams during development.
